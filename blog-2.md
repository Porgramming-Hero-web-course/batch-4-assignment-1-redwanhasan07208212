### Introduction:

TypeScript adds powerful features to JavaScript, and two of the most helpful are union and intersection types. These features make it easier to work with data that can have different shapes or combine multiple kinds of information in one place. Let’s break down what these types are and why they’re useful.

### Union Types: One Type Out of Many

Union types allow a variable to be one of several types. Think of it as an "OR" option in TypeScript. For example, we might have a function that accepts either a string or a number. With union types, we can define it like this:

```tsx
let id: string | number;
```

Here, id can either be a string or a number. This is especially helpful when we’re working with data that can have multiple formats, like user inputs or API responses.

### Intersection Types: All Types in One

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. Think of it as an "AND" option. If we want an object to have all properties of two types, we can use an intersection type:

```tsx
type Person = { name: string; age: number };
type Employee = { companyId: string };
type PersonEmployee = Person & Employee;
```

In this example, PersonEmployee will have all the properties of Person and Employee, so it must have name, age, and companyId. This is great when we want a type that combines data from multiple sources.

Intersection types are perfect for creating complex types with clear requirements. If we need an object with all properties from multiple types, intersection types make it easy to define and work with.
